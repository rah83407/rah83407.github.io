	<p>Last month, Atlanta United FC, a Major League Soccer expansion franchise, saw their season come to an abrupt finish in a home loss to Columbus Crew in the first round of the MLS Cup Playoffs. Many fans across the southeast, primarily in the state of Georgia, were heartbroken to see their new beloved club fall short of a bigger goal. But in the bigger picture, that was the closing to an unexpected successful 2017 season. Many people felt that a soccer club in Atlanta would struggle because unless the team wound up being good, it was believed that their attendance would be an issue. They were wrong.
	<p>From game one, where 55,000 fans filled Bobby Dodd Stadium, to the final game of the season, where more than 67,000 filled Mercedes-Benz Stadium, fans came out in both quality and quantity. As seen in the chart below, Atlanta United shattered a variety of MLS attendance:</p>
	<table border=2 style="color:#FFFFFF">
		<tr>
			<th>Atlanta United Attendance Records</th>
		</tr>
		<tr> 
			<td> MLS Record Broken </td>
			<td> Attendance </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> Average Attendance Per Game </td>
			<td> 48,200 </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> Single Game Attendance </td>
		    <td> 71,784 </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> Single Playoff Game Attendance </td>
			<td> 67,221 </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> Season Total Number of Tickets Sold </td>
			<td> 886,625 </td>
		</TABLE>
	<p>As you can see, this team picked up popularity quickly, giving future expansion franchises a potential blueprint for success for the future that includes the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Passiontate front office with prior experience</li>
		<li>Energetic style of play</li>
		<li>Strong social media presence to captivate potential fans</li>
	</ul>
